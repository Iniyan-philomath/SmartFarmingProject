## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **API Keys**
   - Never commit `.env` file with real API keys
   - Use different API keys for development and production
   - Rotate API keys regularly
   - Use environment variables only

2. **WiFi Security**
   - Use WPA3 (or WPA2) encryption, not WEP
   - Use strong passwords (20+ characters)
   - Change default WiFi password
   - Disable WPS (WiFi Protected Setup)

3. **Backend Security**
   - Always use HTTPS in production
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Use strong authentication
   - Validate all inputs
   - Keep dependencies updated

4. **Hardware Security**
   - Store ESP32 in secure location
   - Use power monitoring to detect tampering
   - Consider GPS tracking for valuable deployments

### For Developers

1. **Code Review**
   - Review all external contributions
   - Check for common vulnerabilities
   - Verify library versions
   - Test security scenarios

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Check for known vulnerabilities: `npm audit`
   - Use `snyk` for continuous monitoring
   - Remove unused dependencies

3. **API Development**
   - Validate all inputs (size, type, content)
   - Use parameterized queries for databases
   - Implement CORS properly
   - Add authentication/authorization
   - Log security events
